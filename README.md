# Word Count

A simple website that will take user text as input, and output the total number of words in the block of text, as well as the frequency in which they appear. 

This program was written to explore:
* Python 3
* Django
* URL Routing in Django
* Submitting/Handling HTML Form Data

## Example
After starting up my development server and visiting the website, I entered the following excerpt from Esi Edugyan's _Washington Black_:

```
It was I who had failed in my understanding, you see. Life holds a sanctity for them (referring 
to Solomon Islanders) we can scarcely begin to imagine; it therefore struck them as absurd that 
someone would choose to end it. A great ludicrous act. In any case, it was then I recognized that 
my own values - the tenets I hold dear as an Englishman - they were not the only, nor the best 
values in existence. I understood there were many ways of being in the world, that to privilege one 
rigid set of beliefs over another was to lose something. Everything is bizarre, and everything has 
value. Or if not value, at least merits investigation.
```
After hitting the "Count!" button, I received the following response:

```

```

## Note
This website was intended to be very basic in order to focus on learning other fundamental concepts.
